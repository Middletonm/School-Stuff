## ***Questions***
### Size of and average coffee cup. 
**The** average size of a coffee cup is 8Oz <br>
###
### ***what is the best material for the job ?***
**I** think that **bamboo** would be the best material for the job as it can deal well with heat, it is strong and durable and it can be put in a composte.
Not to mention the fact the growing bamboo has a very positive environmental impact as it produces 35% more oxygen that a normal tree.
Research has shown that bamboo can absorb as much as 12 tonnes of carbon dioxide per hectare per year.
